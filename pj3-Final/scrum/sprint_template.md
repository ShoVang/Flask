# Sprint Planning

Date/Time: April 23 3pm

Participants: adam, sho, josh, munira, Kyler

Goal Statement:  We discused what we should build and how to do it, came up with an idea of a website for a zoo. We orginaly wanted to be basicaly a book keeper / invertory mangement aplication for the zoo but then extend it to build a website for the zoo for the cx to be able to preview the inverntory inside the zoo. We came up with the idea of having a membership, an admin role for manging the inventory, and a year to date goal for the zoo it self. We decided we will track the YTD goals with the membership so that we can make all of our code connected to eachother for a smooth semi automated website. 

# Daily Scrums

# 1 
Date/Time: April 26 12pm

Participants: Sho, Kyler 

Notes...
We discused how we were going to build the UI (html stuff). We came up with the conclusion to add a pie chart with label and that we were going to tie it into the meberships using Query. Kyler was busy workin on pj#2 so i decied to take lead and start a lot of the code. I was going to lay out the basics this weekend. basic front and back end things. Sho had also voluntered to do the read me and fill out the templet. 

# 2 
Date/Time: May 2 10 am

Participants: Sho, Kyler 

Notes...
At this point eveything was done and just needed to be tighed in together, Kyler had also added a change pw feature and I had added a upload image feature that kyler helped me tie in on the back side of things (forms.py). We discused about what was needed next, we conclued that we needed to test and tie in the pie chart still. As well as that we needed to do alot of the none code things still such as filling in the read me better and makesure our code would follow the rubric. as well as unit testing. We need to edit the Readme and specificly the user stories to better show what we wanted to do. in the previous version we had not inclued the YTD goals inside of the readme.

# 3
Date/Time: May 5? 7 pm

Participants: Sho, Kyler 

Notes...
Mosth things done need to finsh the unittesting i started doin resach on what types of test each of them needed to be like , decided to do a calcualtion test for our YTD goal pie chart, we dedced to test the calcuation of the member ships. It was specificly the membership_count method. at this point sho had personal things going on and couldn't realy help till midnight. 

# 4
Date/Time: May 8 3pm 
everything was finshed up, we had made sure things were routed correctly, last step was to fix the black box testing we were thinging about make sure we can navagate through all the html files that we might need. as well as last min stuff inside scrum, and go over the read me one more time to make sure we had filled out all the requrements. 



# Sprint Review

Date/Time: April 30th

Participants: Sho, Kyler

Notes...
At this point we kicked out the members. alot of things were done but were having some issues with data base. Everthing was set up including all the login / sign in material and the main pages (index, status report , add animal ). At this point eveything was going smothly and we were ahead of schedule. I talked to kyler and we dived up the work i would countie to work on the front end of things and attempt back end code as well. At this point the main isues were database and seting up the rest of the html pages. 

# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: May 7 12 AM (midnight)

Participants: Sho 

Notes...
at this point alot of the work was done. Sho had started but need to finsh the unittesting exercise and finsh filling out the sprit stuff. Kyler had fished all if not most of the backended things for the pj #3. He also did alot of the manule testing. Sho just needs to review and possible edit the routes to make them go in the correct order and run any last tests. also fill out all the none code things such as the scrum stuff we did it but never got to document it as it was either in person or short chats in discord.
